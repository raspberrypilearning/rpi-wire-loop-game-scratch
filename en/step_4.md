## Build your wire loop game

In this step, you will build the physical wire loop game to use with your existing Scratch code.

--- task ---

Take four pipe cleaners.

Twist together the ends of the pipe cleaners, so that all four are attached to form one long pipe cleaner. Place them on a piece of aluminium foil.

Wrap the pipe cleaners in the foil, so that they are covered from end to end.

Take another pipe cleaner, wrap it in foil, and then bend it into a loop.

--- task ---

Take the long, wrapped set of pipe cleaners and bend them into an interesting shape. Thread the wire loop you made onto the long wire.
Then, use Plasticine or BluTack to attach the ends of the long wire to a suitable base.

--- task ---

Use a crocodile clip lead to attach one end of the long wire to one of the M-F jumper wires, and another crocodile clip lead to attach the handle of the wire loop to the other M-F jumper wire.

Run your Scratch program, and then try to move the wire loop along the long wire without them touching. Each time they touch, the buzzer should sound.
