Wrap the pipe cleaners in a piece of aluminium foil, so that they are covered from end to end and it looks like one long wire.

Take the long wire made of pipe cleaners and bend it into an interesting shape. Thread the wire loop you made onto the long wire.
Then, use Plasticine or BluTack to attach the ends of the long wire to a suitable base.

Use a crocodile clip lead to attach one end of the long wire to one of the Pin-Socket jumper wires, and another crocodile clip lead to attach the handle of the wire loop to the other Pin-Socket jumper wire.
