legend: Question 1 of 3
---

How can you test that a buzzer you want to use in a circuit is working?

--- choices ---

- ( ) 1: Connect the long leg to a ground pin and the short leg to a 3V3 pin

--- feedback ---

No, the long leg of a buzzer needs to be connected to a power source, and the short leg connected to ground

--- /feedback ---

- (x) 2: Connect the short leg to a GND pin and the long leg to the 3v3 pin (Pin1)

--- feedback ---

Yes. This will start the buzzer sounding straight away, to test that it is working.

- ( ) 3: Connect the long leg to a ground pin and the short leg to a ground pin

--- feedback ---

No. Electricity will not flow between two ground pins, so the buzzer would not sound.

--- /feedback ---

- ( ) 4: Connect the long leg to pin 21 and the short leg to a ground pin.

--- feedback ---

Not quite. Pin 21 will only work, if it is programmed to do so, so this would not be a good test. The 3V3 pin is always on, so should be used for testing.
